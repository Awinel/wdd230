        <h3>Personas 1</h3>
        <p>
          Raul: <br>I am committed to maintaining a healthy lifestyle, I am always
          on the lookout for fresh and nutritious foods. When I discovered a
          webpage that specializes in selling a wide variety of fresh fruits, I
          was thrilled. The webpage not only offered a convenient way to
          purchase high-quality fruits, but it also provided valuable
          information about each fruit's nutritional benefits and preparation
          tips. Since then, I have become a regular customer and have been
          delighted with the quality of the fruits and the exceptional customer
          service.
        </p>
        <h3>Personas 2</h3>
        <p>
          Samantha: <br>My family and I love to try new recipes and experiment with
          different types of fruits. However, it can be challenging to find a
          wide variety of fresh fruits at our local grocery store. This webpage
          allows us to explore new recipes and get creative with our cooking
          while ensuring that we are incorporating plenty of healthy fruits into
          our diet.
